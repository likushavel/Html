    <h1>Vehicle</h1>
    <p>
        A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><span style="color: #4c6375;"><b>[1]</b></span></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo.
         Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams),
          watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters)
           and spacecraft.<sup><span style="color: #4c6375;"><b>[2]</b></span></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering
         and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977
          is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types,
           terms and definitions.<sup><span style="color: #4c6375;"><b>[3]</b></span></sup>
